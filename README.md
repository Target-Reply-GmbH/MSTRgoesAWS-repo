# MSTRgoesAWS-test-repo

This repo intents to bridge the knowledge gaps among business users, frontend and backend engineers, developers, and DevOps engineers.  

The business Intelligence tool MicroStrategy(MSTR) is a modern, open enterprise platform. It provides consumer-grade BI experiences for every role, on any device, with the platform giving sub-second responses at an enterprise scale. MSTR Business Unit of Target Reply focuses on using MSTR to realize data analysis and visualizations, ultimately supporting clients in making data-driven decisions.      

As a lead cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides comprehensive products and services, e.g., Amazon EC2, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Lambda, etc.  

Therefore, the project MSTRgoesAWS aims to combine the most handy functionalities (or products) of MSTR, AWS (and also GitHub) together. 

## Starting Point
In 2021, MSTR BU of Target Reply built a Use case to analyze and forecast global Covid-19 infection, recovery, death, vaccination cases, using ETL, ML, MSTR etc. A interactive dossier in MSTR showcases development trajectory of the infection (recovery, death, vaccination) case, clustered based on geographic locations.
