# MSTRgoesAWS-test-repo

This repo intents to bridge the knowledge gaps among business users, frontend and backend engineers, developers, and DevOps engineers.  

The business Intelligence tool MicroStrategy(MSTR) is a modern, open enterprise platform. It provides consumer-grade BI experiences for every role, on any device, with the platform giving sub-second responses at an enterprise scale. MSTR Business Unit of Target Reply focuses on using MSTR to realize data analysis and visualizations, ultimately supporting clients in their decision making process.      

As a lead cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides comprehensive products and services, e.g. Amazon EC2, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Lambda, etc.  

Therefore, the project MSTRgoesAWS aims to combine the most handy functionalities (or products) of MSTR, AWS (and also GitHub) together. 

## Starting Point
In 2020, MSTR BU of Target Reply built a use case to track, analyze and predict global Covid-19 infection, recovery, death and vaccination cases, by means of ETL, ML, MSTR etc. An interactive and user-friendly dossier (dashboard) in MSTR showcases the development of the infection (recovery, death, vaccination) rate overtime, clustered based on geographic locations. 

## Improvement Potentials 
- Source data is not up-to-date
- Automate developing, testing and deployment of application
- Bring in more flexibility and elasticity 


## Repo Structure 
The mono-repo approach is used for this project, i.e., all codebases and files for documentation purposes are kept in this single repository (MSTRgoesAWS-test-repo).

Besides the main branch, we created three other feature branches based on the teams (ML, ETL, DevOps) so that each team manages its codebase on its own branch. Once the new feature is complete, the feature branch can be merged back into the main branch.
Â 
In this repo, there are seven folders where you can upload your code. We kindly ask you to save your code in the correct folders, i.e., the one with the same extension name as your files. For example, folder py for python files, mp for Abinitio, doc for documentation.
